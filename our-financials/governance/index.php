					<h2>Approach to Corporate Governance</h2>
					<p><strong>The CentrePort Board of Directors (the Board) is committed to maintaining best-practice governance policies and behaviours.</strong></p>
					<p>Policies are tested against applicable standards detailed in NZX’s Corporate Governance Code. The Board’s governance framework adheres to the majority of applicable standards as if the company were a listed public company. 
					<p>In addition, the Directors support the principles set out in the Code of Practice for Directors, issued by the Institute of Directors in New Zealand. While recognising that this code expresses principles and does not purport to determine any detailed course of conduct, the Directors support the need for the highest standards of behaviour and accountability.</p>

					<h2>Board of Directors</h2>
					<p>The Board is elected by shareholders. The Port Companies Act 1988 and the Companies Act 1993 govern the relationship between CentrePort Limited and its shareholders.</p>
