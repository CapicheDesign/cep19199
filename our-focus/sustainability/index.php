					<h2>Waste Minimisation</h2>
					<p><strong>The Waste Minimisation Project is a nationally award-winning initiative which has now been running for two years. It is a concrete commitment from CentrePort to environmental sustainability.</strong></p>
					<p>The project repurposes significant quantities of waste concrete, steel, and asphalt by crushing these valuable materials and turning them into gravel fill at the Kaiwharawhara Point site. The material is then recycled for use in remediation and construction projects on port.</p>
					<p>Since August 2017 a total of 26,297 cubic metres of concrete and 6,568 cubic metres of asphalt has been recycled instead of going to landfill.</p>
					<p>The Waste Minimisation Project won Excellence in Civil Construction at the Concrete New Zealand awards, and was a finalist at the 2019 Wellington Green Gold Awards.</p>
					<p>In mid-2019, the programme expanded to start accepting third-party concrete waste for recycling.</p>
