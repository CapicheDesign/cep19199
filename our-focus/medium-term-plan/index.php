					<h1>Regeneration</h1>
					<div class="heading-divider"></div>

					<p><strong>CentrePort is developing an ambitious regeneration plan that will deliver our vision of a 21st century logistics supply chain asset to benefit the business, the community and the New Zealand economy.</strong></p> 
					<p>The planning is considering a variety of factors including safety, resilience, the environment, technology, risk management, the needs of the community, and the regional and national economies.</p>
					<p>We have and continue to engage with a range of stakeholders, including customers and partners to help shape that plan. We are working with international experts such as Hamburg Consulting and Royal HaskongingDHV and New Zealand-based companies to explore opportunities and consider a wide range of options.</p>

					<h2>Medium-term operating plan</h2>
					<p><strong>The medium-term operating plan focuses on key enablers for regeneration. CentrePort is working on its plan to better serve the needs of customers, people, and region in the future, and build resilience of its critical assets.</strong></p>

					<p>The infrastructure and environment team has spent the last 18 months mapping the port and gathering information and data to make well-informed decisions about the future.</p>  
					<p>A key component of the medium-term operating plan is the demolition programme with 15 structures removed to date. Works to remove the former BNZ and CESCO buildings commenced from mid-2019.  Removal of damaged and redundant structures improves land utilisation by continuing to make additional land available to allow for permanent regeneration works.</p>
					<p>We are also currently improving its entrance and traffic management, including new weighbridges and an extra exit lane.</p>

					<p>Infrastructure assets are also being upgraded to support future resilience. This includes the cranes, Aotea Quay, Kings Wharf, the Interislander Ferry operation, and the Seaview and Burnham Wharves.</p>
					<p>CentrePort has gathered facts around our diesel and electricity use and determined how we can be more efficient and sustainable in the short and longer term.</p>
					<p>In the longer term, CentrePort is looking at how it reimagines what the port will look like in the future.  This includes spatial planning, urban integration, resilience and our environmental and people platforms.</p>

							<h2>StraitNZ Bluebridge – E-site infrastructure</h2>
							<p><strong>CentrePort has been working alongside StraitNZ Bluebridge to improve its operation and layout.</strong></p>
							<p>This included re-engineering the E-sites to more efficiently manage StraitNZ Bluebridge’s drop-trailer operation. This is where the trailers that transit between the North and South Island without a truck and are picked up by a truck cab.</p> 
							<p>CentrePort enlisted the help of a consultant from Royal HaskoningDHV in Liverpool who has designed ferry terminals throughout Europe. This includes the terminal at Holyhead which berths the Ulysses, the largest ferry in the world.</p> 
							<p>Following the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake, StraitNZ Bluebridge had been marshalling drop-trailers on Glasgow Wharf but are now able to marshal them directly behind the vessel.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="case-study--content">
							<p>Taking the trailers on and off the ship now occurs across a 200-metre area rather than an 800-metre to one-kilometre area.</p> 
							<p>StraitNZ Bluebridge has seen a significant increase in its operating efficiency because the distance to travel is significantly shorter.</p>
							<p>This has improved efficiency, speed and helped with overall operations. The finished area looks like a stretch of asphalt with some markings on it, but within its simplicity is a world-class design for marshalling.</p>

							<p>“E-site’s proximity to our berths and the improved traffic flow is delivering important operational benefits to meet the evolving needs of our freight customers.”</p>
