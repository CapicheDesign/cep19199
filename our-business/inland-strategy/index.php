						<p><strong>CentrePortâ€™s inland hub strategy continued to help drive economic success across the lower North Island this year.</strong></p>
						<p>CentrePort and KiwiRail have provided the CentreRail service since 2013. This connects businesses in Taranaki, Whanganui, Manawatu, the Wairarapa and Marlborough to global markets.</p>  
						<p>The inland hubs utilise long-haul rail transport to the port from key aggregation points.  This improves efficiencies in logistics, creating a reliable, sustainable connection from aggregation points to the world.</p>

						<p>The past year saw record CentreRail volumes supported by the continued development of the hub network with volumes of 800 twenty-foot equivalent (TEUs) containers per week.</p> 
						<p>Moving forward, CentrePort is looking to expand the model elsewhere with rail hubs in the planning stages in various locations throughout central New Zealand.</p>
