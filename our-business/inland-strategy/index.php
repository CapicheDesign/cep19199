					<p>The past year saw record CentreRail volumes supported by the continued development of the hub network with volumes of 800 twenty-foot equivalent (TEUs) containers per week.</p> 
					<p>Moving forward, CentrePort is looking to expand the model elsewhere with rail hubs in the planning stages in various locations throughout central New Zealand.</p>

					<p><strong>CentrePort’s inland hub strategy continued to help drive economic success across the lower North Island this year.</strong></p>
					<p>CentrePort and KiwiRail have provided the CentreRail service since 2013. This connects businesses in Taranaki, Whanganui, Manawatu, the Wairarapa and Marlborough to global markets.</p>  
					<p>The inland hubs utilise long-haul rail transport to the port from key aggregation points.  This improves efficiencies in logistics, creating a reliable, sustainable connection from aggregation points to the world.</p>

							<h2>Open Country Dairy</h2>
							<p><strong>Open Country Dairy is the second biggest dairy company in New Zealand, and exports 30 per cent of its products through CentrePort via Whanganui to more than 70 countries across the world.</strong></p>
							<p>Open Country Dairy has a long-standing relationship with CentrePort and moves containerised export product through the Wellington port to its international markets.</p>
							<p>The Ali Arc and CentrePort service provides efficiencies for Open Country Dairy, with certainty of the daily rail service through to CentrePort.</p>

						</blockquote>
						<div class="case-study--content">
							<p>Products ready to export are stored at the Whanganui hub, which is hugely important for Open Country Dairy as it frees up storage at their own facility.  The ability for Ali Arc to recondition containers and manage storage is also a huge benefit to Open Country Dairy.</p>
