					<h2>The incoming wall of wood</h2>
					<p><strong>The lower North Island region’s forests of the 1990s are reaching maturity. This is creating a “wall of wood” and significant growth for the log industry in the region.</strong></p>    
					<p>The growth in log volumes through CentrePort has been significant. Volumes have doubled in the past six years, and this growth is predicted to continue over the next decade.</p>
					<p>A record 1,709,435 JAS (Japanese Agricultural Standard) was exported. This was a 27 per cent increase on the previous year, led by strong demand from China.</p>

					<h2>Putting the log in logistics</h2>
					<p><strong>As logging continues to expand, CentrePort has been looking at innovative ways to continue to develop cost-effective, safe, sustainable and efficient supply chain solutions that reduce truck movements.</strong></p>    
					<p>The Waingawa log hub, outside Masterton, was specifically built to support the efficient and fast movement of logs directly to the Port.</p>  
					<p>CentrePort developed the land at Waingawa, with the rail maintained by KiwiRail, to ensure there is capacity to take logs directly to the port.</p>
					<p>Logs arrive at the Waingawa hub and are sent by rail to Wellington daily.  This has taken a significant number of trucks off the road – reducing the number of truck journeys over the Rimutakas by up to 30,000 annually – an environmental, social and economic win for the region.  Rail also reduces road maintenance coasts and has 66 per cent fewer emissions per tonne compared to trucks.</p>
				
					<p>In July 2019, KiwiRail and CentrePort announced additional capacity from Waingawa from 30 to 45 wagons a day.  Transporting an additional 100,000 tonnes of logs by rail from the Wairarapa to CentrePort will reduce a further 6,000 truck trips annually.  Ultimately the expanded service will increase capacity by up to 200,000 tonnes per annum.</p>
					<p>As log volume continues to increase, we will invest in infrastructure and rail capacity will grow to meet the demand.</p>
