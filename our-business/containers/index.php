					<p><strong>Containers have grown in the past year – showing strong progress in the CentrePort recovery.</strong></p>    
					<p>Containers were up 11 percent this year, with 93,846 Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units (TEUs).</p>
					<p>This year, CentrePort has increased capacity to continue growing the container business.</p>
					<p>CentrePort is also looking at ways to continue to grow volume and efficiently move more container cargo through the port.</p>

					<p>CentrePort made the decision to phase out its straddles cranes due to the uneven nature of the land post-quake. From February 2020 they will be replaced with ‘bomb carts’.</p>
					<p>This will increase lifting capacity from 30 to 70 tonnes – and improve the cycle up to eight minutes from truck-to-crane-to-ship. The bomb carts will also be able to drive directly under cranes – improving safety and productivity.</p>

							<h2>Ali Arc</h2>
							<p><strong>Ali Arc Logistics in Whanganui works in partnership with CentrePort to connect its customers to global networks.</strong></p>

						<blockquote class="case-study--pull-quote m-t-m m-b-lg">
							<p>“We're basically trying to take all the hassle out of it for the customers by providing every service that we can; from devanning a box or an imported container, to delivering the goods to that customer.”</p>

							<p>CentreRail's ability to provide certainty around timing of shipments, efficiency of operations, and flexibility ensures the partnership works well.</p>
							<p>“The relationship is great because our core business is warehousing logistics.  They've got to come from somewhere. If it comes from CentrePort that's the best result for us so the quicker we get with them in and out of the port the better.”</p>
							<p>“We've got the ability to grow with CentrePort, and we're currently working on a development for adding biosecurity services to what we do.</p>
							<p>More than 20 Whanganui businesses currently use the Ali Arc and CentreRail service.</p>
