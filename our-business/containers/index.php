					<p>We are phasing out straddle cranes due to the uneven nature of the land post-quake. From February 2020 these will be replaced with bomb carts.</p>
					<p>This will increase lifting capacity from 30 to 70 tonnes – and improve the cycle from truck-to-crane-to-ship by up to eight minutes. The bomb carts will also be able to drive directly under cranes – improving safety and productivity.</p>

							<h2>Ali Arc</h2>
							<p><strong>Ali Arc Logistics in Whanganui works in partnership with CentrePort to connect its customers to global networks.</strong></p>
							<p>The inland hub allows Ali Arc to offer customers a set price for storage and transportation of containers to the port by rail. This streamlines logistics and operations for exporters.</p>

							<p>CentreRail's ability to provide certainty around timing of shipments, efficiency of operations, and flexibility ensures the partnership works well.</p>
							<p>“The relationship is great because our core business is warehousing logistics.  They've got to come from somewhere. If it comes from CentrePort that's the best result for us so the quicker we get with them in and out of the port the better,” said Bartley.</p>
							<p>“We've got the ability to grow with CentrePort, and we're currently working on a development for adding biosecurity services to what we do.”</p>
							<p>More than 20 Whanganui businesses currently use the Ali Arc and CentreRail service.</p>
