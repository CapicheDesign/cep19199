					<p><strong>This year, CentrePort implemented a fixed flexi-rostering system. This has given the team awareness well in advance when and where they're working, including guaranteed time off and normalised hours.</strong></p>
					<p>This means CentrePort has needed to broaden the range of skills of all of our staff, involving thousands of hours of training through the year. Front line staff get an opportunity to rotate between areas rather than being specialised in one area. This has created a multi-skilled team and has spread the knowledge to keep the team fresh.</p>  
					<p>The training is New Zealand Qualifications Authority approved, providing employees with qualifications that are externally recognised.</p>
